  This situation arises in some Linux distros (Mandriva 2009, Opensuse 11, Fedora 10) when suing the root mode. I couldn't
  find the origin of the problem, which is not present on Debian Lenny, Ubuntu Jaunty, Fedora 11.

- add a tiny terminal program xfvt (~55 KB, based on Xvt 2.1, by John Bovey) that is used in the root mode
  authentication. This allows Xfe to be independent from the terminal program installed on the system. Also used nohup
  to allow closing the terminal without destroying the Xfe window!

Version 1.30
- fix the error message displayed in root mode when the terminal program is not found 
- fix an issue with the gvfs file system when Xfe is launched as root. For now, I choosed to disable the detection
  of this file system, but I must investigate about gvfs to understand what really causes the problem.
- fix a problem in Makefile.am that prevented performing several 'make dist' one after the other
- fix the file type in FileList.cpp when the file is a symbolic link that refers to a file with no association

  applications are started from within Xfe. Note that, even if the option is disabled, xfe, xfi, xfv, xfp and xfw
  still indicate they have started to the window manager (provided that xfe was not compiled with the --disable-sn
  configure option).
- add greek localization (thanks to Nikos Papadopoulos)

  permissions (suid, sgid and sticky) with a warning message for the user about possible unsafe behaviour.
- fix a possible crash when the current directory contains no item (this could arise in some situations where the user
  does not have read access on the directory he is working in)
- set focus on the panels when selecting/deselcting files with Ctrl-A, Ctrl-I, etc.

- fix a segfault in Properties.cpp when performing a chmod or a chown on a file without permissions : the file object
  was deleted too soon
- add a cancel button to the ConfirmOverwriteDialog
- fix the progress dialog that annoyingly appeared behind dialog boxes when a file operation is interrupted
- fix a bug when updating the file panel context menu : the rename menu was not grayed out with multiple file selection 
- fix several memory leaks due to the use of strdup() without corresponding free() 

Version 1.26
- fix the cancel action in the Keybindings dialog : now, cancellation works as expected
- add the total number of files and number of subfolders to the Properties dialog when the selection contains directories
- changing permission or owner of a broken link is now done silently (no more annoying error message) 
- fix the phantom trash menu when the trash can system is disabled
- fix a problem with the wait cursor that was not displayed over the file list in some cases
- modify the trash can system to be more compliant with the Freedesktop standards. Now Xfe creates the info files where
  the original path and the deletion date are stored and displays the original path and deletion date in the file list
  and in the file tooltip.
- fix a problem with static variables in several classes
- moving files to the trash can now creates the .trashinfo files, as required by the freedesktop standards

Version 1.25
- add a Keybindings tab to the Preferences dialog that allows the user to interactively modify the key bindings 
- fix a FOX bug in parseAccel() that prevented key bindings like Ctrl-F10 to be correctly interpreted
- add the _ICONLIST_STANDARD icon list type to distinguish between file lists, serach lists and standard lists
- fix a bug in Preferences.cpp related to the show_mount_prev variable that was not correctly initialized.
- add the onCmdHeaderClicked callback to the IconList. This is to allow the target object to get the message
  that the user has clicked on a header button.

Version 1.24
- fix a problem when trying to create the new config directory or the new trash location if the parent folder does not
  exist. To fix this, I add the mkpath() that creates the parent directrories if necessary.
- fix a non initialized variable (smoothscroll) in XFileImage
- fix a crash of XFilePackage, when opening a package. Since I remove in version 1.22 the icon->create() instruction
  from icons.cpp I had to add similar instructions to the XFilePackage::create() function. This works, but I don't
  clearly understand the origin of the problem.
- change the location of the Xfe config files and the trash can. The new locations are .config/xfe for config files
  and .local/share/Trash/files for trashed files. These are compliant with the Free Desktop standards. Note that
  at the moment, Xfe does not use the info files when trashing files.
- remove the "TRASH" string from trashed file names. This string is indeed not really necessary.
- fix error dialog when copying files on a Windows disk and trying to preserve dates
- fix some untranslated strings in File.cpp
- fix the file filter history and made it retained when quitting Xfe
- add a button to the FilePanel status bar for the file filter command
- display the file filter string in red (and add this color as an attention color to the color theme)
- french translation update
- the copyright string is now in xfedefs.h
- start the work on configurable key bindings for all apps
- add a Shift-Tab keyboard shortcut to cycle through the panels in reverse order. Note it is only useful in tree and 
  two panels mode
- enable again the keyboard shortcuts on the DirPanel because now we have a way to know which panel is active. Thus it
  is no more confusing to use shortcuts everywhere

Version 1.23
- now shell scripts cannot be executed but are edited or viewed in all cases. This prevent to launch scripts by mistake.
- fix a problem where in some cases files could have an association but no file type
- fix a problem when navigating through the main menu using the keyboard : in one panel and tree panel modes, the 
  right panel menu appeared as a "phantom" menu. Now it's fix. 
- fix a problem when cancelling a drag and drop operation: the operation is now globally stopped as it should be
- avoid refreshing the directory size when when performing lenghty file operation (copy/move/delete, etc.) on a large
  number of files
- some code optimization to improve performances when xfe lists files in a big FileList
- improve xfe startup time by reducing the number of calls to FileList::listItems() to 2 instead of 6!
- add a tooltip text for the active icon of each panel
- when the path linker is not displayed (selected from the Preferences dialog), display a path text instead in every file list
- stop refreshing the file list when performing lenghty file operation on a large number of files. This prevent flickering
  and speeds up a bit the file operation
- fix a severe performance issue when pasting a long list of files. This was because of the \r character at the end of 
  the uri strings that I remove from clipboard string to be compliant with nautilus. I completely remove the \r character
  and tested copy/paste/dnd operations with nautilus, konqueror, thunar, dolphin, krusader, rox and pcmanfm. Everything seems
  OK now.
- now Xfe tests if folders have sub-folders or not and displays the tree list accordingly

Version 1.22
- all mounted file systems (including proc, sys, dev) now have the proper icon. Removeable media also have the
  file system icon and can be unmounted by the user if he has the correct permissions.
- fix the CXXFLAGS that was unappropriately cleared before compiling
- fix a compilation bug with gcc 4.4 (strstr now returns a constant char* instead of a char*)
- fix the terminal command string for root mode. This string must be included within quotes for some terminals
  to work as expected
- add a Ctrl-l shortcut to clear the location bar and allow to directly enter text into the text field
- fix a memory leak related to the run and open ComboBox history
- change the clipboard content when copying file names from Xfe to a text application. Now, the full pathes of all the 
  selected files are pasted, as it seems to be the standard behaviour

Version 1.21
- add an option to let Xfi list only known image types
- saving the window position when quitting an application is now optional. This is to be more consistent with the
  default behaviour of modern applications and window managers
- fix the confirmation message when deleting non empty folder. Added a Yes for All button to the message box.
- replace "foreground color" with "text color" in the Preferences dialog, because it is more informative
- fix some focus problems on the file list when clicking on an already checked toolbar button (or activating the button
  using a shortcut)
- now in MessageBox, we can justify text and place icon as desired  
- the type-to-jump-to-filename feature now can be case insensitive, and is now coherent with the file list sort order
- in panel cycling, made the selected item always visible when focus shifts to a panel
- add desktop files to start Xfe and the related tools from the desktop menu
- add translator names to the Xfe about menu
- add a led icon to the panels that helps to distinguish which panel has the focus. Removed the old gray out
  mechanism
- fix the file list background color, because it was wrongly obtained from the main background color 
- fix a serious performance issue with xfv and xfw when opening large files. This was due to the isutf8()
  function which was very badly coded (shame on me)
- limited the scrollbar button size to barsize*2 instead of barsize/2
- some polish of the main windows
- customise gui control hilite and shadow colors for better looking themes

- fix a FOX issue in the FileList, where in row mode the scrolling was vertically instead of horizontally
- fix a FOX issue that prevented composed characters to be input when the mouse pointer is not within the text field
- fix a FOX issue in FXTextField that crashed some input dialogs when FOX was compiled with the --with-xim option
- fix a FOX issue in FXComposeContext that prevented any character to be input when FOX was compiled
  with the --with-xim option (to get support for composed characters)

- when right clicking in an empty place in the directory tree, display the panel context menu
- fix the normal color of Xfv, Xfw, Xfi and Xfp when they are started for the first time before Xfe. 
- workaround for a bug on Openbox window manager that caused Xfe and other applications to start at the first time
  with a hidden window bar. Now, we simply start at (50,50 instead of (0,0). Perhaps, an Openbox or FOX bug? 
- fix a bug that prevented to rename a file or directory using the Properties dialog
- fix a bug with the path linker that caused a continuous refresh of Xfe and then a high CPU usage
- add a new menu item to the file list to autosize icon names in icon view.

  date
- in detailed mode, fix a problem with column darkening when sorting from the main or popup menu  
- change all occurrences of the "filepath" variable to "pathname", to be more consistent for developments
- improve the way the FileList is periodically refreshed. Now, we don't force anymore a complete refresh every 30 seconds
  as before, except when something really change. This allows Xfe to avoid continuously refreshing the thumbnails.
  which is prohibitive when there are large images. 
- add a FILEDIALOG section the xfe registry in replacement of the "filedialog_*" options.

Version 1.19 (released 11-06-2008)
- fix copy/move operations when dragging files to the tree list : we don't want to change the current directory to
  the target directory (thanks to Mathis Dirksen-Thedens for this tip)
- update swedish translation (thanks to Anders F Björklund <afb@algonet.se>)

Version 1.18 (released 05-06-2008)
- in FileDialog and detailed mode, we also retain the size of each column
- in Xfe, normal and text fonts can now be change at the same time without restarting Xfe after each change
- in Xfi, Xfw, Xfv and Xfp, the OPTIONS section of the configuration files is related to the application specific local
  options. The SETTINGS section is reserved for more general options, like for example FOX options. This is more
  consistent with the convention adopted for Xfe (the main application).
- fix a bug that prevented Xfi to retain its file list mode and its icon arangement 
- the file dialog now saves its state (size, list mode, hidden files, thumbnails, ...) between sessions and applications 
- update japanese translation (thanks to Karl Skewes <karl@garagedori.com>)

- change a bit the way the registry directories and files are managed. However, it should be transparent for the end user.
  The vendor key is not used anymore in the registry but it is still used during the application creation to set the WM_CLASS
  window property.

- add an option to display or hide the FilePanel path linker
- we now use the .cpp extension for the source files, instead of .cc . This is to be consistent with the FOX library.
- xterm is no more required for the root mode. Now, if xterm is not present on the system, we use the terminal program 
  that is specified in the Preferences dialog. However, xterm is still the default and the user's terminal is only used
  as a fallback. This is because xterm has many options that can be used to nicely format the user dialog.
- update chinese translation (thanks to xinli <xinliGG@gmail.com>)
- fix a small problem in file operation dialogs with the size of the command message. Now, we adjust the message size

- in the xferc config file, the OPTIONS section is now reserved to xfe specific options. Other options that
  are common to all four applications are now saved under the SETTINGS section of xferc. Nothing change in
  other config files. Note : when reading the xfe registry from Xfv and others, generic FOX options like wheellines,
  selbackcolor, etc., are automatically read from the xferc config file. Specific options like single_click, file_tooltips,
  etc., must be read explicitely.  
- file dialogs now retain their size, mode and also the hidden files and thumbnails state

Version 1.09
- fix a bug that prevented dragging files from Xfe to the ROX filer or desktop
- fix a bug that prevented unmounting removable file systems after executing some copy/move/extract/etc. function
  in Xfe (this was related to the chdir performed before some operations)
- in FilePanel, the starting directory of the extract to command is now set to the home directory
- add an option to avoid displaying tooltips in the FileList or DirList 
- display again some information in the status bar when only one file is selected. This useful when navigating using the keyboard
- allow again file names without extension to have their icon (there is still a problem with file names like zip or cc,
  but I have no solution for them at the moment)
- allow again empty file names in FileDialog (why did I remove this feature in version 1.07?)
- fix a bug when dragging files to the FilePanel : the Pathlinker was not refreshed correctly
- fix a bug when copying/pasting/renaming/symlinking or dragging a directory in the DirList :
  now we correctly display the target directory

Version 1.07
- fix a pointer problem in the function isEmptyDir() of File.cc (thanks to Tobias Ulmer)
- single click file and directory open options are now completely independant
- add a new panel context menu item that allows to open the panel context menu. The old control right click
  way is still there.

- add error dialogs when nothing is entered in an operation dialog
- fix problems with some error dialogs when errno is not set
- fix the refresh problem of the FileList when moving a dialog upon it (add the isOdd() function to the IconItem
  class, thanks to Alain Ducasse for the tip)

Version 1.06
- when sorting files in the FileList, if option Directories first is checked, then directories are always
  displayed on top of the list. This seems indeed more convenient.
- modify browse input dialog to distinguish between the cases of single and multiple files selections
- add a menu item to create a new symbolic link refering an existing file or directory
- add an option to set the smooth scrolling on/off in the Preferences dialog. This is only valid for file lists.

  directory instead of doing nothing
- fix a crash bug in XFileImage, because the numsortheader variable was not initialized in IconList

- fix several bugs in PathLinker that prevented correct display of the path buttons in some cases
- synchronized bookmarks between different Xfe instances
- fix a small bug in DialogBox, where hitting the return key didn't activate the OK button

- better consistency in the FilePanel status
- add more informations to the tooltip displayed when hovering on an item in the FileList

- I realized that the directory size in detail panel mode is not useful, so I remove it

Version 0.99.4 (pre release)
- add the ability to use sudo instead of su for the root mode. This allows Ubuntu users to use the root mode, and
  sudo is more versatile than su.
- FOX hack to display non UTF-8 file names (e.g. 8 bits) correctly. A warning message is displayed in file dialogs
  when the file name is not in UTF-8. It is possible to copy/move/rename files with non UTF-8 file names but string
  manipulation into the text field is ugly. This is due to the fact that FOX 1.6.x don't directly support anymore
  8 bits strings.  

Version 0.99.3 (pre release)
- fix a problem when testing if the distribution used in Debian based. I tested the presence of "apt-get" but
  it seems more appropriate to test the existence of "dpkg" on the system

  cross icon on the window
- replace the create archive dialog with a (hopefully) more intuitive one
- replace the DirlistBox with a FileDialog (more powerful) when extracting archives
- add the ability to browse files for selecting destination in file operations

- add Brazilian Portuguese translation (thanks to Jose Carlos Medeiros <jcnascimento@gmail.com>)
- add a popup menu to select the drag type (copy, move, link or cancel) when dragging file(s) to Xfe

Version 0.99.2 (pre release)
- add the ability to click on the panel title to set the focus on it
- fix an issue when opening a new Xfe window : the starting directory was not always the home directory
  as it should be
- add clipboard support to Xfe : we can now copy/cut/paste from and to Nautilus (Gnome Desktop), Konqueror
  (KDE desktop) and Thunar (XFCE desktop). Copying and pasting from and to any file manager that uses the standard
  text/uri-list type should also work.

Version 0.99.1 (pre release)
- fix a problem with Matlab file icons in xferc.in
- update and fix the french translation
- reintroduced the filter indication in FilePanel. It was lost since the introduction of the path link widget.

Version 0.99 (released 12-03-2007)
- fix missing su dialogs when trying to create a new file or folder in FilePanel and DirPanel
- update to gettext 0.16.1
- add the image size (in pixels) to the XFileImage window title

- change the cursor to a hand when browsing using a single click
- add options to allow single click file and directory open in FilePanel, FileDialog and XFileImage
- file copy operations now keep the original date of the input files or directory (although it is not the default in the Unix /bin/cp
  command, it is the default in many file managers, and it is more useful from the user point of view)
- fix a crash bug when creating a link to the / directory
- fix typos in cleanPath() and filePath()
- fix a small typo in Preferences.h
- fix a bug that prevented settings to be retained on Mac OS X (and other systems?)
- update czech translation (thanks to David Vachulka <david@konstrukce-cad.com>)
- update deutsch translation (thanks to Joo Martin <debian@joomart.de>)

Version 0.98.2 (released 20-02-2007)
- add stuff to create a self extracting package. The user can type sh xfe-0.99-i386.sh to install Xfe to /usr/local
- add a Windows icon theme
- converted ru.po to UTF-8
- fix a crash bug whith the FileDialog when associating a program to a file (the StringList pointers were not
  defined because setDirectory() was not called)
- fix a bug with the progress bar when copying files of size > 4GB. The percentage was not correctly displayed.
- remove the statout() and lstatout() functions that were too slow on a computer with a lot of NFS or Samba mount
  points. They are replace by statrep() and lstatrep() that are faster.
  The timeout for down mount points is now 30 seconds (this is the default timeout of stat() and lstat() on Linux systems),
  and the mtab is checked every 5 seconds. Up and down mount points are now refreshed every 5 minutes.
  This change should make Xfe more responsive in the general case, but less reponsive when some mount points are not
  respondind. This is the tradeoff...
- replace exit() by _exit() in every fork child

Version 0.98.1 (released 13-02-2007)
- I realized that xfe could not be installed by a non root user because of the /etc/xfe/xferc configuration file
  location. So I decided to move this file to $prefix/share/xfe/xferc which can easily be customized by a user
  that wants to install xfe in a non system place.
- fix a bug in pkgInstall() that prevented packages to be installed when xfe is started from a directory which
  is not the same as the package directory
- converted most of po files to UTF-8
- avoid zombies by using system() instead of execl() in the runcmd() function
- add the forgotten pclose() in main.cc and XFileQuery.cc that produced a sh zombie
- fix a bug with diacritic symbols when the locale is not set to UTF-8 (thanks to David Vachulka <david@konstrukce-cad.com
  for the tip)
