====================================== TODO List and Known Issues======================================


Known Issues
------------

- to allow composed characters (like ä, Ö, ê, etc.) to be entered in xfe, xfw, etc., the FOX library *must* be
  compiled with the --with-xim configure option.

- in Xfw, if the wordwrap mode is selected an line numbers are displayed, then the line numbers are uncorrectly
  displayed for wrapped lines. This is a FOX issue.


To Do
------

- implement file operations using threads (image thumbnails, copy...)

- internationalization should handle multiple plural forms (required by languages like polish, czech, etc.)
